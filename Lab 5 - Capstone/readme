# Campus Energy-Use Dashboard

**Name:** Swastik Saxena
**Roll No:** 2501730307
**Assignment:** Capstone Project - Energy Consumption Analysis

## 📌 Project Objective
This capstone project implements an end-to-end data pipeline to analyze electricity usage across campus buildings. It automates the ingestion of raw meter data, performs statistical aggregation, and generates visual dashboards to aid in administrative decision-making.

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### 1. Prerequisites
You need Python installed along with the following libraries:
pip install pandas matplotlib

### 2. ⚠️ Important: Data Directory Setup
The script requires a specific folder structure to run. Before running the script, you must:

1. Create a folder named "data" in the same directory as the script.
2. Place your CSV files inside this folder.
3. Ensure your CSV filenames start with the building name (e.g., Science_usage.csv, Library_data.csv).

Required Folder Structure:
Project_Folder/
├── main.py
├── README.md
└── data/               <-- YOU MUST CREATE THIS FOLDER
    ├── Science_usage.csv
    └── Library_usage.csv

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project folder.
3. Run the script:
   python main.py
4. Check the /output/ folder for the results.

## 🧠 Methodology
This solution addresses the assignment tasks as follows:
* **Ingestion:** Uses `os` and `pandas` to validate and merge multiple CSV files, handling exceptions for missing or corrupt files.
* **OOP Design:** Implements `Building` and `MeterReading` classes to model the physical system.
* **Aggregation:** Calculates daily totals and building-specific statistics (mean, min, max).
* **Visualization:** Generates a dashboard with trend lines, bar charts, and scatter plots.
* **Persistence:** Exports clean datasets and a summary text file to the output directory.

## 📊 Outputs
After execution, the "output" folder will contain:
1. dashboard.png: A visualization of daily trends and peak loads.
2. cleaned_energy_data.csv: The merged dataset.
3. building_summary.csv: Statistical summary per building.
4. summary.txt: A concise executive summary report.
